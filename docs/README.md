Traffic Flow Optimization and Congestion Management
Problem: Evaluating the traffic congestion shown by map engine services against the calculated actual congestion using the Drone.

Solution: 
1. Detection of objects through YOLO v8 model
2. Analyzing the coordinates of the drone
3. Detected videos to frames
4. Classification, validation, and severity analysis through the VGG16 model
5. Email alerts through SMTP protocols
