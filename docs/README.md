Traffic Flow Optimization and Congestion Management
Problem: Evaluating the traffic congestion shown by map engine services against the calculated actual congestion using the Drone.

Solution: 
-> Detection of objects through YOLO v8 model
-> Analyzing the coordinates of the drone
-> Detected videos to frames 
-> Classification, validation, and severity analysis through the VGG16 model
-> Email alerts through SMTP protocols
